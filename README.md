# Shinyapp-Poster-2021-Symposium
This is my interactive Shiny poster as presented in the Western Biochem 2021 Graduate Symposium - titled "Metagenomic analysis of bacterial communities from an oil refinery wastewater treatment plant".

Currently, you can view the Nanopore sequencing statistics for each sample and the assembly statistics of each putative MAG, in either a circos plot format or within a reactable.

Since then, I generated much more sequencing data and gained more experience with R. The app in its current state is rough and will need to be updated to include the new data. In hindsight, a lot could be improved - from the app itself, to the way the data is collected, and the way the figures are generated.

The scripts to generate the circos plots are included here as well.
